# recipe generator
## My first nlp generator 

## Please link to this repo if you use code from here, or just fork it

### steps:

1. data_scraping.py - you must change food_url => others fields too, because, I think, I have no rule to submit website from which I do scrapping.
So, after running this script we have result .pkl file, which have dictionaries of recepies(name, instructions,etc)

2. Then you need to use data_manipulating.ipynb to make sequences
3. model_training.py - for train and retrain model
4. generating_test.ipynb - to test your results

5. telegram_bot.py - use your api token.
